    <div>
      <h6 class="card-title"> The rebirth of Typed Unfancy Javascript.... The rebellious teenage love child of TypeScript and Python who is their own person and seeks validation from neither... ( But deep down loves them both and would love their approval)</h6>
    </div>
<h5>MambaScript is a language that compiles to JavaScript and also an alternative to JSX when building React and similar libraries. It attempts to have a similar coding style to python but yet also have the flexibility of TypeScript. The project comes with many awesome features that can be used in projects of any size and the application you are using now is a markdown blog made with the MambaScript Decision Package which allows you to use libraries like react to build user interfaces without JSX. MambaScript code compiles to ES5 JavaScript nice and clean but still allows you to write code very similar to ES6 with additional bells and whistles and some fluff taken out of it. I am very excited about the project.
