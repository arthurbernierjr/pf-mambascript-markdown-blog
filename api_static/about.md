    <h5 class="container mx-auto">"Arthur is exceptionally friendly, knowledgable, and community-oriented. He is a driven worker who I feel especially fortunate to have studied with at General Assembly. Not only did Arthur excel in the immersive web development program, but he managed his time so well that he successfully completed freelance projects during the course and always made himself available to help others with their coursework. Just being around Arthur has inspired me to dig deeper in my own work."

I was fortunate enough to work with him on a couple of group projects while at General Assembly, his work was always well thought out and executed. And he is always looking to push himself and his skills to the next level. His skills as a manager and helping a group stay on task are extremely effective. Arthur approaches this task not by micromanaging, but by being an open communicator, positive influence, and leading by example. His presence in the classroom at GA surely elevated my skills and attitude about the craft of programming, and my experience would not have been the same without him there."</h5>
