# Rust Guides

Rust offers memory safety without garbage collection and fearless concurrency. Perfect for systems programming, WebAssembly, and performance-critical applications.

---

## Core Concepts

- [Rust Introduction](/guides/rust/intro) - Getting started with Rust
- [Rust OOP Patterns](/guides/rust/oop) - Structs, traits, and impl blocks

## Web Development

- [Routing](/guides/rust/routing) - HTTP routing with Actix/Axum
- [Building APIs](/guides/rust/api) - RESTful services in Rust

---

## Learning Path

1. Start with [Rust Introduction](/guides/rust/intro) - ownership and borrowing
2. Learn [OOP patterns](/guides/rust/oop) - traits and implementations
3. Build [HTTP routes](/guides/rust/routing) - web frameworks
4. Create [APIs](/guides/rust/api) - high-performance services

## Why Rust?

- **Memory safety** - No null pointer exceptions, no data races
- **Zero-cost abstractions** - High-level code, low-level performance
- **Fearless concurrency** - Compiler catches race conditions
- **WebAssembly** - Run in browsers at near-native speed

## Compare with Other Languages

- [Go](/guides/go) - Simplicity vs safety tradeoffs
- [Java](/guides/java) - Memory management approaches
- [JavaScript](/guides/javascript) - WebAssembly integration
