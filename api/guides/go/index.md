# Go (Golang) Guides

Go is Google's language designed for simplicity, reliability, and efficiency. Perfect for building APIs, microservices, and concurrent applications.

## Core Concepts

- [Go Introduction](/guides/go/intro) - Getting started with Go
- [Object-Oriented Go](/guides/go/oop) - Structs, interfaces, and composition

## Web Development

- [Routing](/guides/go/routing) - HTTP routing patterns
- [Building APIs](/guides/go/api) - RESTful services with Go

---

## Learning Path

1. Start with [Go Introduction](/guides/go/intro) - syntax and tooling
2. Learn [OOP patterns](/guides/go/oop) - structs and interfaces
3. Build [HTTP routes](/guides/go/routing) - web server basics
4. Create [REST APIs](/guides/go/api) - production services

## Why Go?

- **Fast compilation** - Near-instant builds
- **Built-in concurrency** - Goroutines and channels
- **Static typing** - Catch errors at compile time
- **Single binary** - Easy deployment

## Compare with Other Languages

- [JavaScript](/guides/javascript) - Dynamic vs static typing
- [Python](/guides/python) - Interpreted vs compiled
- [Rust](/guides/rust) - Memory safety approaches
