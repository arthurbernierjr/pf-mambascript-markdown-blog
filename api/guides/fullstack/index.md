# Full-Stack Development

Combine frontend and backend skills to build complete web applications. These guides cover architecture patterns and practical implementation.

---

## Architecture & Patterns

- [MERN Stack Architecture](/guides/fullstack/mern-architecture) - MongoDB, Express, React, Node
- [SSR vs CSR](/guides/fullstack/ssr-vs-csr) - Server-side vs client-side rendering
- [API Design](/guides/fullstack/api-design) - Designing robust APIs

## Common Features

- [Authentication](/guides/fullstack/authentication) - User auth in full-stack apps
- [File Uploads](/guides/fullstack/file-uploads) - Handling file storage
- [Real-time Features](/guides/fullstack/realtime) - WebSockets and live updates
- [Search Implementation](/guides/fullstack/search) - Building search functionality

## Learning Path

**Building your first full-stack app:**

1. Understand [MERN Architecture](/guides/fullstack/mern-architecture)
2. Learn [API Design](/guides/fullstack/api-design)
3. Implement [Authentication](/guides/fullstack/authentication)
4. Add [File Uploads](/guides/fullstack/file-uploads)
5. Enhance with [Real-time Features](/guides/fullstack/realtime)
6. Optimize with [Search](/guides/fullstack/search)

## The Full-Stack Mindset

A full-stack developer thinks about:

- **User Experience** - How does the frontend feel?
- **Data Flow** - How does data move through the system?
- **Security** - Is every layer protected?
- **Performance** - Is it fast enough?
- **Scalability** - Can it handle growth?

## Prerequisites

- [JavaScript Fundamentals](/guides/javascript/fundamentals)
- [Async JavaScript](/guides/javascript/async)
- [REST APIs](/guides/concepts/rest)
- [Databases](/guides/concepts/databases)
