# Object-Oriented JavaScript

JavaScript supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented programming. Learn how to structure your code using classes, prototypes, and inheritance patterns.

---

## Core Concepts

- [Classes](/guides/javascript/oop/classes) - ES6 class syntax and patterns
- [Prototypes](/guides/javascript/oop/prototypes) - JavaScript's inheritance model

---

## Learning Path

1. Start with [Prototypes](/guides/javascript/oop/prototypes) - understand how JavaScript inheritance actually works
2. Learn [Classes](/guides/javascript/oop/classes) - the modern syntax built on top of prototypes

---

## Prerequisites

Before learning OOP in JavaScript, make sure you understand:

- [Objects](/guides/javascript/fundamentals/objects)
- [Functions](/guides/javascript/fundamentals/functions)
- [The `this` Keyword](/guides/javascript/fundamentals/this)

## Compare with Other Languages

See how OOP works in other languages:

- [Python OOP](/guides/python/oop)
- [Ruby OOP](/guides/ruby/oop)
- [Java OOP](/guides/java/oop)
- [Go OOP](/guides/go/oop)
