# Asynchronous JavaScript

JavaScript is single-threaded, but that doesn't mean it can't handle multiple operations. Learn how to write non-blocking code that keeps your applications fast and responsive.

---

## Core Concepts

- [Promises](/guides/javascript/async/promises) - The foundation of async JavaScript
- [Async/Await](/guides/javascript/async/async-await) - Modern syntax for handling promises
- [The Event Loop](/guides/javascript/async/event-loop) - How JavaScript handles concurrent operations

## Practical Applications

- [Fetch API](/guides/javascript/async/fetch) - Making HTTP requests
- [Error Handling](/guides/javascript/async/error-handling) - Managing async errors gracefully

---

## Learning Path

1. Start with [Promises](/guides/javascript/async/promises) - understand the callback pattern and why promises were created
2. Learn [Async/Await](/guides/javascript/async/async-await) - the modern way to write async code
3. Deep dive into [The Event Loop](/guides/javascript/async/event-loop) - understand how JavaScript actually works
4. Apply your knowledge with [Fetch API](/guides/javascript/async/fetch) - make real API calls
5. Master [Error Handling](/guides/javascript/async/error-handling) - build robust applications

---

## Prerequisites

Before diving into async JavaScript, make sure you understand:

- [Functions](/guides/javascript/fundamentals/functions)
- [Closures](/guides/javascript/fundamentals/closures)
- [The `this` Keyword](/guides/javascript/fundamentals/this)

## Next Steps

- [REST APIs](/guides/concepts/rest) - Design and consume RESTful services
- [Full-Stack Development](/guides/fullstack/mern-architecture) - Build complete applications
